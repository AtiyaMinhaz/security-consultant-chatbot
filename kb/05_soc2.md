# SOC 2 (Customer Trust)

SOC 2 focuses on Trust Services Criteria (TSC).
Security is always included; others are optional (Availability, Confidentiality, etc.)

Typical expectations:
- MFA + access reviews
- Change management + SDLC evidence
- Logging/monitoring + IR plan
- Vendor risk management
- Vulnerability management + patch SLAs
- Backups + restore tests
