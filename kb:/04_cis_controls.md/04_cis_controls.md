CIS Controls (use as an implementation checklist):
- Inventory and control of enterprise assets and software
- Secure configuration of devices and software
- Account management and access control (MFA, least privilege)
- Continuous vulnerability management (patching, scanning)
- Audit logs, monitoring, and incident response capability
- Data protection (encryption, classification, retention)

For startups: pick a minimal set and implement iteratively with measurable outcomes.
