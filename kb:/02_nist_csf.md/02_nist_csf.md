NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) high-level structure:
- Identify: asset inventory, business context, governance, risk assessment, supply chain.
- Protect: access control, training, data security, maintenance, protective technology.
- Detect: monitoring, detection processes, anomaly/event analysis.
- Respond: response planning, communications, analysis, mitigation, improvements.
- Recover: recovery planning, improvements, communications.

Use CSF to organize a security program narrative and roadmap.
