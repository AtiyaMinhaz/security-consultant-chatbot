Privacy basics (non-legal, operational):
- Collect only what you need (data minimization).
- Define purpose for data collection and retention.
- Publish a privacy notice (what you collect, why, sharing, retention).
- Provide a process for access/deletion requests if applicable.
- Secure data transfers and vendor contracts (DPAs where relevant).
- Protect PII with encryption, least privilege, and logging.

If operating in EU/EEA, GDPR may apply; confirm obligations with qualified counsel.
