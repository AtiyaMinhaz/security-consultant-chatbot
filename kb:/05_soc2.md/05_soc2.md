SOC 2 (practical interpretation for early businesses):
- Customers want assurance that controls exist and evidence is retained.
- Common control themes: access control, change management, incident response, vendor oversight, availability, backups.
- Evidence matters: tickets, approvals, logs, access reviews, policies, training records.

SOC 2 is not a “tool”—it is a control/evidence program and (optionally) an audit report.
