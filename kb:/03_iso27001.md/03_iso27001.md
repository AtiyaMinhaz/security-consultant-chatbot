ISO/IEC 27001 concepts (simplified):
- Establish an ISMS: define scope, roles, policies, risk methodology, and objectives.
- Risk treatment: assess risks, select controls, document decisions, and track action plans.
- Documented information: policies, procedures, and records as evidence.
- Continual improvement: internal reviews, audits, corrective actions, management oversight.

For startups: use ISO 27001 as governance inspiration without overbuilding bureaucracy.
