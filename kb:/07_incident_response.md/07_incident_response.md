Incident Response (IR) essentials:
- Define severity levels and escalation paths.
- Have a triage process: detect, validate, scope, contain, eradicate, recover.
- Preserve evidence when needed (logs, timestamps, access history).
- Run tabletop exercises to validate readiness.
- Post-incident: root cause analysis and corrective actions.

For startups: a lightweight IR plan is better than none; practice it quarterly.
